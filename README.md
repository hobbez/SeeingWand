# Seeing Wand

Point the Seeing Wand, push the button, and it will tell you what it sees. This fun project can be built over a few hours and has a practical side for the vision impaired. Yes, "there is an app for that," but the form factor is much cooler and the cost less than a smartphone as it is based on the $10 Raspberry Pi Zero W.
